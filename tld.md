TLDR; Most developers don’t know how to solve two sum problem, basics are missing and they can’t answer questions from the very projects they mentioned in their resume.

Edit: This post isn’t about whether DSA is good format or not for interviews. It is about getting your basics right.

I start most of my interviews with the first problem from LeetCode i.e Two Sum. I am surprised that not a lot of folks can answer even a naive approach, just today I was was interviewing someone with 9 years of experience. And it was very sad to see the guy struggle. My motive behind this is to ask an easy question and then go in depth, i.e optimised implementation -> usage of maps -> different map implementations, hashmaps -> how hashmaps works and then eventually down to system level on heap and memory management. But sadly not a lot of people can move past naive approach, which I think is okay to do your job but you won’t be able to move up the ladder.

Also I always ask this question irrespective of their role (backend, frontend or whatever) because I feel if they can answer this at satisfactory level, that's enough for me to know that you know what you’re doing even if they have already solved this question before.

For frontend folks, I often ask them to explain the event loop to me and surprisingly 90% of the folks don’t even know what an event loop is. One person said they only know angular and not JavaScript !! Please learn basics, don’t jump into frontend frameworks directly with typescript. If you’re using a framework, well and good, but you should know how to build the same webapp or functionality without the framework. I am just asking you should know this, not that you should do it. Knowing it makes you better at your job. I have experienced that knowing these things makes you write better code, knowing event loop helped me write very IO optimised code.

Please carefully design your resume, and be prepared to answer questions from it. If you’re adding up made up projects in it, at least know everything that an interviewer can ask and be confident when you answer. Lot of times I know when a project is made up.

I hope this is helpful.
